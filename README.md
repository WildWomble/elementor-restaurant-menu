On click it will open other info about the product such as Ingredients and Nutrition Facts. On Mobile it will display this info as a full screen popup which disappears on tap/click.

Made it as a learning experience, i do not plan to fix bugs or errors in a fast manner.

Simply install it, activate and within the Elementor Live builder, search for Restaurant Menu.
