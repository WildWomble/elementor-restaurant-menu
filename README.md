STILL A WIP!

A simple addon for Elementor to display a menu for restaurants/catering depending on 2 languages chosen.

[Working Example](https://lunabistro.ro/meniu-restaurant/)

On click it will open other info about the product such as Ingredients and Nutrition Facts. On Mobile it will display this info as a full screen popup which disappears on tap/click.

Made it as a learning experience.

Simply install it, activate and within the Elementor Live builder, search for Restaurant Menu.
